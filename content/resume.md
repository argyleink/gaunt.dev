## Work Experience

### Google

###### June 2012 - Current [Staff Developer Programs Engineer]

During my career at [Google](https://careers.google.com/) I've had the privilege
of working with a number of teams in different roles and focuses.

I originally joined as a developer advocate, later became a developer
programs engineer, my current title is Staff Developer Programs Engineer with
may day-to-day focus being purely software development.

Below are some of the highlights in terms of projects and work.

##### Engineering Manager

- As the engineering team within OSPO (Open Source Programs Office) grew, I
became the engineering manager for the compliance team and later took on
the GitHub team as well.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring the teams were happy during pandemic while
unblocking releasing and reducing risk for Google.

##### GitHub Enterprise Management

- I was engineering lead for the majority of the enterprise contract with
GitHub. This required tooling for cleanup during the initial agreement,
monitoring and tooling for ongoing negotiations and planning to make sure
we could oversee and track our usage of GitHub.
- **Challenges**: Understanding GitHub's usage, meeting tight deadlines due
to last minute requests or changes and identifying and fixing
gaps / features, delegating projects to team members.

##### Incident Response

- Folks at Google will turn to OSPO for support and help when an incident
occurs. Working with teams to put processes in place for on-going
assessments as well as immediate support for high risk incidents
- **Challenges**: Tools are need for quick response and having knowledge
of GitHub, Open Source Software and Googles infra is need to adequately
help.

##### Good engineering practices and process

- One of the primary focuses I had when joining the OSPO engineering team
was to establish testing norms. This was part effort to encourage team
members to learn and adopt unit tests as well as provide clear guidance
on integration tests. This helped for buy in for further automation from
other members of the team because we knew a release was relatively safe
to release is tests were passing.
- **Challenges**: Establish best practices for testing, setup CI/CD for coverage
and improve runtime of integration tests through cleanup and documentation.

##### Google Technologies

- Before joining OSPO 2019, I had little experience of Google
technologies, largely working on GitHub. I learnt a number of the Google
technologies and shared responsibility in running cron jobs, databases,
web sites and CLI tools.
- **Challenges**: Learning Google technologies, Google coding standards
and understanding existing code bases enough to maintain them.

##### Workbox

- Workbox is a set of web/node libraries that simplify using service workers
to make
[progressive web apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application).
I was team lead for the initial versions of Workbox and a core dev for
several of the modules and test infra.
- **Challenges**: We wanted to replace existing libraries, so compat was a concern,
we wanted the libraries help with usability while being safe to use in a
dev and prod environment.

##### Firebase

- Once web push started to gain adoption amongst browser vendors, the
Firebase team expressed interest in adding support for web push to their
Web SDK and Cloud Messaging service. I lead the proposal and
implementation of the SDK, later adding support for VAPID and converting
the library from Closure to Typescript.
- I later became web platform lead for the Firebase API team, review new
API proposals.
- **Challenges**: The web SDK did not support service workers, so I worked
with the team to address that, never worked with the Firebase SDK before
and the API design had to be flexible enough to support future features.
Supporting early access partners during development.

##### Web Push & Service Workers

- In the early days of service workers and web push I learnt and wrote about
these technologies to share knowledge and lessons, both internally with
spec authors and enigeers as well as externally with the web developer
community. I wrote a section of the
[Smashing Book 5](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/smashing-book-5-real-life-responsive-web-design)
on service workers and was acknowledged in the [web push spec](https://w3c.github.io/push-api/#acknowledgements).
- **Challenges**: Evolving specs, trying to maximise adoption and getting buy
in to deprecate libraries in favor on contributing to community librares
([See web-push-libs on GitHub](https://github.com/web-push-libs/)).

##### Chromium Based WebView

- I lead developer outreach of the Android WebView change moving from
WebKit to Chromium.
- **Challenges**: Needed experience in web and Android, clients had a vast
array of use cases and hacks for the original WebView.

##### Google TV & Chromecast

- When I joined Google I was the hired to be developer relations for the
release of Google TV in Europe and later support the launch of Chromecast
in Europe.
- **Challenges**: Understanding the TV landscape in Europe, support partners
and conducting outreach for EU developers.

##### Advocacy

### Future Platforms

###### May 2011 - June 2012 [Software Engineer]

[Future Platforms](https://www.futureplatforms.com/) was a small agency
when I joined in the beautiful city of Brighton, UK, which was later purchased
by Vexxed.

- Worked in a small team to deliver a range of applications to clients.
- Developed for the Android, iOS, Nokia QT and Blackberry platforms.
- Worked on a cross platform framework called KirinJS.

### Mubaloo

###### Sep 2010 - May 2011 [Software Engineer]

I was an intern for Mubaloo and consultant before joining
[Mubaloo](https://twitter.com/mubaloo) full time. The company grew from 5 to
40 people during my time there.

- Led the Android developer team.
- Project manager for several small projects.
- Regular meetings with clients.
- Android and Blackberry app development.

## Skills

TL;DR: I'm a jack of all trades, master of none, but better than one.

I'm finding myself drawn towards testing and DevOps style work in the past
few years of my work as it's helped me find confidence in the work I'm doing
in new technologies and it provides the project with an avenue for team growth.

A project with good tests shouldn't fear new contributors because the risk of
change is lower than a project without tests.

If you'd like a list of recent areas of recent work:

- Testing
- Golang
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Web Technologies
- Node

# Hello.

I'm Matt Gaunt, I'm a jack of all trades software engineer,
[previously a senior software engineer at Google](/resume).

## Projects

### Web Push Book

Having spent a large amount of time playing with web push I put together a collection of information into a kind of book that you can grab [from the web-push-book](https://web-push-book.gauntface.com/).

### Smashing Book 5

I've written a chapter in the [Smashing Book 5](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/smashing-book-5-real-life-responsive-web-design) on service workers and it's now available in print or ebook.
